Welcome to my academic homepage! I am a Senior Lecturer in Financial Technology based in Glasgow, Scotland, where I focus on the intersection of artificial intelligence and financial services.

## Research Interests

My research centers on developing innovative AI-driven solutions for the financial sector, with particular emphasis on:

* **Multimodal Analytics**: Developing systems that can process and analyze multiple types of financial data simultaneously (text, audio, visual, numerical)
* **Earnings Call Analysis**: Creating AI tools to extract meaningful insights from corporate earnings conferences
* **FinTech Innovation**: Exploring how emerging technologies can transform financial services
* **AI Applications in Finance**: Investigating practical applications of machine learning and AI in financial decision-making

## Current Projects

I am currently working on several exciting projects that combine cutting-edge AI techniques with real-world financial applications. These include developing multimodal systems for financial communication analysis and exploring the use of multi-agent AI systems in financial research.

## Teaching & Mentoring

I am passionate about educating the next generation of FinTech professionals and researchers. My teaching focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical financial concepts and practical technology implementation.

## Collaboration & Consultancy

I actively collaborate with industry partners and provide consultancy services to organizations looking to integrate AI solutions into their financial operations. Please see my [Consultancy & Training](/consultancy/) page for more information about how we might work together.
